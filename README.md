# Augur Constant Product Market

The Augur Constant Product Market is an implementation of a constant product automated market maker (AMM) for Augur prediction markets. It enables users to:

- Provide liquidity
- Enter or exit positions
- Swap between different Augur share tokens (YES, NO, INVALID)
- This contract operates similarly to Uniswap, where the product of the two token reserves remains constant during trades.
